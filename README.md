Augustana Student Academic Conference
Our project was to create a scheduling program for the Augustana Student Academic Conference. 
It was to effectively replace their current scheduling model, which consists of google forms, post-it notes, and email correspondence. 
A fairly inefficient and time consuming model. Given the clients needs we decided our program should take the form of an web application and would perform three key actions. 
Firstly, the application would allow anyone with a Ualberta google account to view the Augustana Student Academic Conference schedule for the current term. 
Second, the program enables professors to submit student presentations for the conference and edit the data of current submissions created by them. 
Lastly, under the action of an admin or moderator it would create a schedule based off of the submissions from professors and schedule settings created by the admin or moderator. 
It will then allow all users to see the schedule once it has been created. 
This is a necessary program to have because the current method of implementation can cause large delays in getting the schedule out to people. 
There is as also a large chance of loss of data through submissions over google form because it is easy to lose track of emails.
